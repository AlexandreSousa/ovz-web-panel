#summary Database description

= Introduction =

Panel uses database to store information about virtual servers, physical servers, users, requests and etc. The source of one part of information is a state of physical and virtual servers. The second part of information is related to business logic of the panel itself (users, requests).

== SQLite ==

By default panel uses SQLite for database. It's located in `/opt/ovz-web-panel/db/production.sqlite3` file. SQLite is lightweight database engine, which suits panel needs well.

== MySQL ==

MySQL is well known and true database engine. It's possible to switch panel to MySQL. Below is the instruction for Debian 5, but similar steps can be made for other Linux distributions (assumes that panel already installed):
  * `apt-get install mysql-server libmysql-ruby`
  * replace "production" section in `/opt/ovz-web-panel/config/database.yml` file (see below)
  * `cd /opt/ovz-web-panel/`
  * `rake db:create RAILS_ENV="production"`
  * `rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"`
  * `/etc/init.d/owp restart`

Parameters for "production" section in `/opt/ovz-web-panel/config/database.yml` file:
{{{
production:
  adapter: mysql
  database: owp
  username: root
  password: *****
  encoding: utf8
}}}

== Other Database Engines ==

Other database engines are officially not supported by the panel. But in theory it's possible to adapt the panel to use other database engines, because panel was built on top of Ruby on Rails framework.
